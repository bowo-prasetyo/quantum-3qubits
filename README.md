# 3 Qubits Quantum Simulator

A minimal client-side quantum computer simulator built with modern browser technologies.

The application demonstrates the fundamental behavior of a 3-qubit quantum computer directly inside the browser without requiring any backend server.

The simulator supports:

- Single-qubit gates
- Two-qubit operations
- Bell state generation
- Quantum entanglement
- Quantum measurement
- Probability visualization

The application is fully client-side and deployable on GitHub Pages.

## Supported Quantum Gates

### Single-Qubit Gates

| Gate | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| I | Identity Gate | Leaves the selected qubit unchanged |
| H | Hadamard Gate | Creates quantum superposition |
| X | Pauli-X Gate | Quantum NOT gate |
| Y | Pauli-Y Gate | Quantum rotation using imaginary phase |
| Z | Pauli-Z Gate | Quantum phase flip |
| S | Phase Gate | 90° quantum phase rotation |
| T | π/8 Gate | 45° quantum phase rotation |

### Two-Qubit Gates

| Gate | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| CNOT | Controlled-NOT Gate | Conditionally flips the target qubit |

---

## Quantum State Representation

The simulator represents a 2-qubit quantum system as:

```text
|ψ⟩ = α|00⟩ + β|01⟩ + γ|10⟩ + δ|11⟩
```

Where:

- α, β, γ, and δ are complex probability amplitudes
- The total probability must equal 1

Normalization rule:

```text
|α|² + |β|² + |γ|² + |δ|² = 1
```

---

## Probability Visualization

The simulator visualizes measurement probabilities using probability bars.

The bars represent:

- |00⟩
- |01⟩
- |10⟩
- |11⟩

Taller bars indicate higher probability of measurement.

This visualization helps users understand:

- Superposition
- Probability amplitudes
- Entanglement behavior
- Quantum gate effects
- Measurement collapse

---

## Bell States And Entanglement

The simulator can generate Bell states such as:

```text
(|00⟩ + |11⟩) / √2
```

using:

1. Hadamard gate
2. CNOT gate

This creates quantum entanglement.

Entangled qubits behave as a connected quantum system where measurements become correlated.

Typical Bell-state measurements become:

- |00⟩
- |11⟩

while:

- |01⟩
- |10⟩

rarely appear.

## Architecture

### Main Thread

Responsible for:

- Vue UI rendering
- Canvas visualization
- Probability rendering
- Router navigation
- IndexedDB persistence
- User interaction

### Web Worker

Responsible for:

- Quantum gate computation
- Matrix-vector multiplication
- CNOT operations
